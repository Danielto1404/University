Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide,[72] and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million,[73] ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.[74])<br><br>
